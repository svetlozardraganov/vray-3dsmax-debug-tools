# V-Ray for 3dsmax Debug Tools
A collection of MaxScripts for troubleshooting 3ds Max projects created with V-Ray.
The main focus of the project is to provide the 3d engineer the ability to quickly analyze unknown 3ds Max scenes and find potential issues.
Here is a short list of the supported functionalities:
- Version information - current/saved v-ray version, installed/recommended gpu-driver
- Demo scenes - predefined scenes for testing purposes
- Select tools - allows to quickly select 3ds max nodes by type like modifiers, object types, light-types, proxy objects
- Lights tools - allows quickly control of all lights in the scene
- Material tools - allows to quickly select materials by types and unsupported materials
- V-Ray MaxScript parameters - list and control over all V-Ray Render Settings parameters
- Render Settings Comparison - ability to compare and switch back and forth between current vs default render settings
- Sanity Tools - ability to quickly find objects in the scene with non-default V-Ray TraceSets, V-Ray Properties, and Object Properties
- Assets Control

# Challenges
MaxScript is not a very popular scripting language and there aren't many resources over the internet. The usual google-search stragegy didn't work very well so I have to rely mainly on MaxScript Reference documentation which was also challenging due to very poor search engine. 

# Technology
- MaxScript - the entire tool is written on MaxScript language. No external modules are used.

# What I learned
- How to interact with 3ds Max and V-Ray using the MaxScript scripting language. 
- How to build native 3ds Max GUI interface
- How to build a set of tools for work optimization
