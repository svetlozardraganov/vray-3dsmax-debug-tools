# V-Ray for 3dsmax Debug Tools
A collection of MaxScripts for troubleshooting 3ds Max projects created with V-Ray.
The main focus of the project is to provide the 3d engineer the ability to quickly analyze unknown 3ds Max scenes and find potential issues.
Here is a short list of the supported functionalities:
- Version information - current/saved v-ray version, installed/recommended gpu-driver
- Demo scenes - predefined scenes for testing purposes
- Select tools - allows to quickly select 3ds max nodes by type like modifiers, object types, light-types, proxy objects
- Lights tools - allows quickly control of all lights in the scene
- Material tools - allows to quickly select materials by types and unsupported materials
- V-Ray MaxScript parameters - list and control over all V-Ray Render Settings parameters
- Render Settings Comparison - ability to compare and switch back and forth between current vs default render settings
- Sanity Tools - ability to quickly find objects in the scene with non-default V-Ray TraceSets, V-Ray Properties, and Object Properties
- Assets Control
